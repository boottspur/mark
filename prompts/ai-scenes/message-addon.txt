IMPORTANT: Include the following message prominently on the page (decoded from URL): "{MESSAGE}"
- Display this message below or near "MARK"
- Make it clearly readable but stylistically consistent with the design
- The message should appear after a brief delay (1-2 seconds)
- Use responsive font sizing (clamp, vw units, or similar)
- Ensure it's readable on mobile devices
- Position it so it doesn't overlap with the main "MARK" text
