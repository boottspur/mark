Create a creative, animated HTML page that prominently features the word "MARK". 
The page should be self-contained (single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript).

CRITICAL Requirements:
- MUST fill entire viewport (100vw x 100vh) with NO visible containers or boxes
- NO scrolling, NO borders, NO visible boundaries
- Use body { margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 100vw; height: 100vh; overflow: hidden; }
- Dark or vibrant background that fills the entire screen
- The word "MARK" should be the focal point
- Include smooth animations (CSS or JS)
- Be visually striking and unique
- MOBILE-FIRST: Must look perfect on small screens (320px+)
- Use responsive units: vw, vh, rem, em - NO fixed pixel sizes for layout
- Keep it under 100 lines of code
- Use modern CSS/JS features

AVOID:
- Containers with fixed dimensions
- Visible boxes or frames
- Any content that creates visual boundaries
- Fixed pixel widths/heights for main elements

Be creative! Ideas: particle effects, 3D transforms, generative art, physics simulations, typography play, glowing neon effects, wave animations, fractal patterns, kaleidoscope effects, or interactive mouse/touch effects that fill the ENTIRE screen seamlessly.
